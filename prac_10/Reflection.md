Initially, my estimate of how long the actual task would take was not very accurate. I often underestimate the complexity and time required of coding assignments. As the course progressed, experience taught me that breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks allowed me to better predict how long it would take to complete them.

Through the review, I learned the importance of clear and concise code, and the value of well-documented comments. While doing code reviews, I realized the importance of providing feedback and focusing on code quality.

If I were in charge of this subject, I would introduce more real-world projects for coding exercises because practical experience is valuable in reinforcing programming concepts.
