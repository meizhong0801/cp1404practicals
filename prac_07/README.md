In the process of working on this repository, I have gained valuable insights into the principles of writing clean 
and maintainable code. Clean code is essential for ensuring that your programs are readable, 
understandable, and easy to maintain. 

Consistent Formatting: 
This includes using consistent indentation, spacing, and naming conventions throughout the codebase.
